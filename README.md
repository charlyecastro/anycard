## WHAT
Anycard allows you to combine technology with magic. you scan the back of your participants card and can make their card before  you. You can take pictures and present it to your

## WHY
Aside from coding, playing soccer and indulging in entertainment, I am also a fan of magic. I'ts another hobbie of mine that I am not too bad at (still an amateaur though). Technology and magic are huge wow factors that amaze people, so i decided to partner them up. They make a great duo and thats why I made the magic AR app, anycard.

## IMPROVEMENTS
 - As of now anycard can only recognize the back of **red** playing cards. I would like to add more options such as blue cards, etc. 
 - I would also like to add the functionality of scanning the face of playing cards.
 - The UI for the settings page needs a fresh look, so I plan on cleaning that up.
 - I would like to add customization, such that the user can upload their own cards to the app. Allowing it to scan any type of deck of cards.
